DFM WordPress Theme
Created by: upstartBureau

-- DESCRIPTION --

Most of what is happening is restricted to the blog effected pages
What this means is that the following pages have been altered for 
style and functionality where it was appropriate.

index.php
header.php
footer.php
nav-below.php
nav-below-single.php
single.php
404.php
archive.php
entry-meta.php
entry-footer.php

Any functional overrides that would need to be made, should be made 
to the functions.php that is existant in this (DFMtheme) folder.x

The chages that were made to the login and administration pages are
simply style changes and are all located in the /wp-admin/css/* dir.
